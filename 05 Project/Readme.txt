Explore IBM Cloud Functions

IBM Cloud Functions is a distributed compute service that executes application logic in response to requests from web or mobile apps. You can set up specific actions to occur based on HTTP-based API requests from web apps or mobile apps, and from event-based requests from services like Cloudant.

    REST ? Representational State Transfer. It contains CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) operation. The type of http request determines the kind of the operation. Following are the types of operation:

    1. GET – For getting data 
    2. POST – For creating data 
    3. PUT – For updating data 
    4. DELETE – For deleting data 

    IBM Cloud Functions?  A cloud function action is a piece of code that performs one specific task. Action can be written in language of your choice(JavaScript, Swift, Python, Java, etc), either as a source code or a docker image. A trigger is a declaration that you want to react to a certain type of event. Steps:
    1. Create an IBM cloud account.
    2. Create an action.
    3. Create a trigger.
    4. Create a web action. 
    
    Why IBM Cloud function? Because it provides service deployment and operational model
    
    Trigger? Trigger is anything that runs a code in response to an event. Event can be emitted by services or can be in the form of API calls.
    Minute-trigger will trigger the action every minute. We will go to monitor to see the activity of our actions and trigger.
