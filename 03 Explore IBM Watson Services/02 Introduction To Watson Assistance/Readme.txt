STEP 1 - BUILD YOUR OWN AI ASSISTANT(CHATBOT) WITH IBM WATSON ASSISTANT- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hitUOFNne14

    WHAT IS CHATBOT? A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over internet. 
    
    TURING TEST? A Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being.
    
    3 main things that IBM Watson Assistant needs - 
    1. Intent(Purpose) - What is user's intension
    2. Entities - It provides more and specific information about the intent. 
    3. Dialogue - Dialogue puts together intents and entities to be able to a personalized response.
    For eg - User asks 'How do I get to the rasetrack'
    * Intent - location
    * Entities - racetrack 
    
    In IBM Watson Assistant, we first also write the test cases before we write the code.
    
    Integerating BAConBot - Using this technique, you can connect your IBM watson assistant to connect with slack, facebook messenger, twillio, etc.
    
    
STEP 2 - IBM CLOUD: HOW TO USE WATSON ASSISTANT WITH WEBHOOKS - https://www.youtube.com/embed/5z3i5IsBVnk

    WHAT IS WEBHOOK?A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program.

    IBM Cloud Function? IBM Cloud Function allows you to 	execute code in response to an event OR direct requests.

STEP 4 - IBM WATSON ASSISTANT: SEARCH SKILL - https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UgRPaxipgI

    SKILLS?
    We can create 2 types of skills:
1. Dialog Skills: Uses Watson natural language processing and machine learning technologies to understand user questions and requests, and respond to them with answers that are authored by you.
2. Search skill: You create a skill of each type. You can add documents, add urls, etc.
